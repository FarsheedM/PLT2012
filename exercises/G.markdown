Programming Languages and Types

Exercise session G on 03.12.2012

Hand in

- anytime
- as a single Scala, Markdown or PDF file to pllecture@informatik, or
- in paper form during lectures or exercise sessions.

Solution will be posted before 10.12.12, 1000 hrs.

The tutor shall give feedback to each submission, without giving
points. Homework does not count toward course requirement. Do them for
your own benefit.

While everyone should write their own solution, it is recommended to
work face-to-face in small groups.


I. First-class continuations
============================

In which system can one implement a `letcc` construct? Justify your
answer with brief explanations or implementation ideas.

a.  Direct-style interpreter, direct-style programme.

b.  Direct-style interpreter, CPS-transformed programme.

c.  CPS-transformed interpreter, direct-style programme.

d.  CPS-transformed interpreter, CPS-transformed programme.



II. Defunctionalisation
=======================

a.  Explain what defunctionalization is and what it is good for.

b.  Lambda-lift the following program:
    
    def fold[A,B](f: (A, B) => A, e: A, l: List[B]): A = 
      l match {
        case Nil => e
        case x :: xs => fold(f, f((e, x)), xs)
      }
    
    fold((x, y) => (x + y) / 2, 1, List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

c.  Defunctionalise the resulting program.

d.  Repeat steps b and c for the following use of fold.

    fold((f: Int => Int, g: Int => Int) => (z: Int) => f(g(z)),
         (z: Int) => z,
         List(x => x+1, x => x+2, x => x-1, x => x*2))
