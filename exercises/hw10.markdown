#Homework 10#

##Abstract Syntax vs. Concrete Syntax##

1. Give the abstract syntax for the language ABE (Arithmetic-Boolean
Expressions) presented in the lecture, in BNF and in Scala.

2. Give a concrete syntax other than infix notation for ABE.  That is, choose
either prefix notation or postfix notation.

##Inductive Definitions and Rule Induction##

1. Give an inductive definition for the ternary relation *Rem*:

   > *(m, n) rem r* if *r* is the remainder when *n* is divided by *m*, where
   > *m /= 0*.

   You can assume the availability of other arithmetic operations or
relations.

2. Use the inductive definition for *Rem*, prove that

   > *(m, n) Rem r1* and *(m, n) Rem r2* implies *r1 = r2*.

##Evaluation Semantics vs Reduction Semantics##

1. Give the evaluation semantics for ABE.

2. Implement both the evaluation semantics and the multi-step reduction
semantics for ABE.  Show that the two implementations give the same results
for the same expressions by a reasonable number of tests.

3. Prove that the evaluation semantics coincides with the multi-step reduction
semantics.

   > For every *e (- Exp*, *e ===> v* if and only if _e --->\* v_.
